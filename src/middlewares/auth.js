/*
Notes:
1.  passport.authenticate(ABC,EFG,verifyCallback(req, resolve, reject))(req, res, next);

    -In simpler terms, this line is executing the verifyCallback function with the provided arguments (req, resolve, reject), 
      and then immediately invoking the resulting function with the arguments (req, res, next). It's a way of chaining function calls together.
    -passport.authenticate() returns another middleware function.

2. When Passport.js attempts to authenticate a request using the JWT strategy, it internally invokes the callback function provided to passport.authenticate.
    Passport.js passes three arguments to this callback function: err, user, and info.

  -err: Represents any error that occurred during the authentication process. If there was no error, err will be null.
  -user: Represents the authenticated user object. If authentication was successful, user will contain the user details retrieved from the JWT token or database.
  -info: Contains additional information about the authentication process.

3. why we are doing method chaining (without dot operator too):
   passport.authenticate(...., verifyCallback(req, resolve, reject))(req, res, next);

   -Because we need to use a controller function inside the passport.authenticate that will handle the control eg: pass the control to 
   next middleware or return response directly from here (maybe in case if authentication fails). So to mimic that we have done it.

   -According to the passport.js documentation:

   app.post('/profile', passport.authenticate('jwt', { session: false }),
   //our controller to control the flow
    function(req, res) {
        res.send(req.user.profile);
    }
    );
